Installation instructions for SZIN++
=================================

1) Configuration.
---------------- 

SZIN++ has been modified to use the GNU autoconf build system.
To configure you have to execute the command:

./configure <configuration options>

Some important options for SZIN++ are

        --enable-fermion-type=<fermion-type>
	--with-qdp=DIR
	--with-qdp-cxxflags=QDP_CXXFLAGS
	--with-qdp-ldflags=QDP_LDFLAGS
	--with-qdp-libs=QDP_LIBS
        --with-qmp-cxxflags=QMP_CXXFLAGS
	--with-qmp-ldflags=QMP_LDFLAGS
	--with-qmp-libs=QMP_LIBS
	--with-qmp-comms-type=<comms-type>
	--with-qmp-comms-cxxflags=QMP_COMMS_CXXFLAGS
	--with-qmp-comms-ldflags=QMP_COMMS_LDFLAGS
	--with-qmp-comms-libs=QMP_COMMS_LIBS
        --prefix=<installation directory>

If a recent version of qdp++ (v0.26 or higher) is being used, it will
have created a file in the install directory called <installdir>/config/qdp_build_env.sh. This should contain the values for all the environment variables
needed for compilation, namely: QDP_CXXFLAGS, QDP_LDFLAGS, QDP_LIBS,
QMP_CXXFLAGS, QMP_LDFLAGS, QMP_LIBS and QMP_COMMS_CXXFLAGS, QMP_COMMS_LDFLAGS,
QMP_COMMS_LIBS. If the command line option --with-qdp=DIR is given, 
with DIR being the installation directory of the QDP++ system, the configure
script will source the qdp_build_env.sh and pick up all the relevant 
environment variables, but:

CAVEAT 1: All the environment variables in the qdp_build_env.sh are guarded
by an if test "x$QMP_ENV_VAR" == "x" ... construct, so that if the shell
which sources the qdp_build_env.sh (which is usually the shell that runs
configure) has the relevant environment variables already defined, the 
ones provided by qdp_build_env.sh WILL NOT override the already existing 
values. Likewise, the values in qdp_build_env.sh can be overridden 
by the --with-qdp-xxxx=<value> options.

CAVEAT 2: If QMP has been compiled with a wrapper script, such as mpicc
then the values of QMP_COMMS_CXXFLAGS, QMP_COMMS_LDFLAGS, QMP_COMMS_LIBS
environment variables may not be set in qdp_build_env.sh as the wrapper
scripts hide these from the user. In this case one must EITHER:

manually set these environment variables before calling ./configure for SZIN++

OR 

the user must use the mpiCC wrapper from the same MPI esque distribution
that was used to build QMP

 OR 

the user must set the values of these environment variables using the 
--with-qmp-comms-flags --with-qmp-comms-ldflags and --with-qmp-comms-libs 
command line switches to ./configure

The full description of the environment variables relating to QDP++ and 
QMP are as follows:

QDP_CXXFLAGS  -- Compiler flags to give the C++ compiler about QDP 
		 in particular the include path flags to find QDP headers
	         eg: QDP_CXXFLAGS="-I/usr/local/qdp++/include" 
		 or  --with-qdp-cxxflags="-I/usr/local/qdp++/include" if
		 QDP is installed in /usr/local/qdp++

QDP_LDFLAGS   -- Linker flags to give to the linker for QDP
	         in particular the link path flags to find the QDP library
		 eg: QDP_LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/qdp++/lib" or
		     --with-qdp-ldflags="-L/usr/local/qdp++/lib" if QDP++
		 is installed in /usr/local/qdp++

QDP_LIBS      -- Linker library flags to give to the linker for QDP
		 eg: QDP_LIBS="-lqdp" or --with-qdp-libs="-lqdp"


QMP_CXXFLAGS  -- Compiler flags to give the C++ compiler about QMP 
		 in particular the include path flags to find QMP headers
	         eg: QMP_CXXFLAGS="-I/usr/local/qmp/include" 
		 or  --with-qmp-cxxflags="-I/usr/local/qmp/include" if
		 qmp is installed in /usr/local/qmp

QMP_LDFLAGS   -- Linker flags to give to the linker for QMP
	         in particular the link path flags to find the QMP library
		 eg: QMP_LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/qmp/lib" or
		     --with-qmp-ldflags="-L/usr/local/qmp/lib" if qmp
		 is installed in /usr/local/qmp

QMP_LIBS      -- Linker library flags to give to the linker for QMP
		 eg: QMP_LIBS="-lqmp" or --with-qmp-libs="-lqmp"

QMP_COMMS_CXXFLAGS -- Compiler flags to give the C++ compiler about 
		additional packages needed by QMP for its comms subsystem
		eg: QMP_COMMS_CXXFLAGS="-I/usr/local/mpich/include" 
		or --with-qmp-comms-cxxflags="-I/usr/local/mpich/include"
		for a QMP built over MPI using mpich where mpich is 
		installed in /usr/local/mpich

QMP_COMMS_LDFLAGS -- Linker flags to give the C++ compiler about a
		about additional packages needed by QMP for its comms
		comms subsystem eg:
		
                QMP_COMMS_LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/mpich/lib \
				   -L/usr/local/gm/binary/lib"
		
		--with-qmp-comms-ldflags="-L/usr/local/mpich/lib \
                  -L/usr/local/gm/binary/lib"

		for QMP over MPI over GM, where the MPI is MPICH-GM installed
		in /usr/local/mpich and the GM drivers are in /usr/local/gm

QMP_COMMS_LIBS  -- additional libraries to do with QMP for its comms
		subsystem eg:
	
		QMP_COMMS_LIBS="-lmpich -lpmpich" 
		-- with-qmp-comms-libs="-lmpich -lpmpich"
		
		if QMP is built over a version of MPICH using Ethernet.

In particular if your comms system underneath QMP is MPI, you may 
have some wrapper script such as mpiCC. You can use this compiler, 
which can hide QMP_COMMS_CXXFLAGS QMP_COMMS_LDFLAGS and QMP_LIBS 
by say:

./configure CXX=mpiCC \
	    --with-qdp-cxxflags=/usr/local/qdp++/include   \
	    --with-qdp-ldflags=/usr/local/qdp++/lib        \
	    --with-qdp-libs="-lqdp"                        \
            --with-qmp-cxxflags=/usr/local/qmp/include     \
	    --with-qmp-ldflags=/usr/local/qmp/lib          \
	    --with-qmp-libs="-lqmp"



The other individual switches:

--enable-fermion-type=<fermion-type> Specifies which fermion type should
				  be used. Allowed values are:
			            wilson  -- Wilsonesque Fermions
				    staggered -- Staggeredesque Fermions
				  
				  The default value is 'wilson'.

 --prefix=<installdir>            specifies where the QDP headers 
                                  and libraries should be installed 
                                  when you type: make install. 
	                          By default it is set to /usr/local.


 --with-qmp-comms-type=<comms-type>    This specifies what comms harness QMP
                                  is to be built over. Allowed values for
	                          COMMS_TYPE are:
				     MPI  -- Build over MPI (also MPI/GM)
				     GM   -- Build over GM.

				  this flag is only needed for non scalar
				  builds. Its default value is MPI



Specifying a compiler:

You can specify a compiler by using the CXX environment variable on the 
configure command line eg:

./configure CXX=xlC 

or 

./configure CXX=powerpc-gnu-elf-g++

This currently takes care of the cross compiling issues, as there is currently
no need to distinguish between host and target compilers.

Autoconf guesses some default compiler flags for you. On Linux this is
usually "-g -O2 -Wall". You can override (specify more optimisations)
by defining the CXXFLAGS variable which gets passed on by autoconf.
Likewise if you need extra libraries (like -lm) you can specify these
with LDFLAGS and LIBS environment variables eg:

./configure CXX=g++ CXXFLAGS="-O3" LIBS="-lm"

2) Building
-----------
There are several ways to build SZIN++

a) SZIN++ is suitable for 'installation' (where you make the programs, and
install them and then just run them -- This is likely to be the least common
method of using szin++). In this case just type 

make 
make install

in the directory where you typed configure. The libraries and executables
will be installed in whatever you set --prefix to.

b) Working in the build directory:

To make the libszin.a library type:

cd lib ; make

in the directory where you ran configure.

To make the mainprogs/tests programs type:

cd mainprogs/tests ; make
or
cd mainprogs/main ; make 

-- in this case ALL the available programs in mainprogs/tests  or
in mainprogs/main  will be built. In the current setup, if a program
in mainprogs/main or mainprogs/tests needs the libszin.a to be built
it should be built automatically.

Alternatively, if you want to build an individual program say t_mesplq,
you can do it by typing:

cd mainprogs/tests ; make t_mesplq

in the build directory.

3) Building in a different directory from the Source
----------------------------------------------------

This is supported, and may be desirable if you wish to have several
different configurations of the same source tree around. 
Suppose you have the distribution unpacked in directory szin++
you can then build say a scalar version in ./scalar-build as follows

mkdir ./scalar-build
cd ./scalar-build
../qdp/configure --with-qdp-cxxflags="-I/usr/local/qdp++-scalar/include" \
  --with-qdp-ldflags="-L/usr/local/qdp++-scalar/lib" --with-qdp-libs="-lqdp"
gmake

should build everything (libraries, mainprogs) using a scalar version
of QDP++ or you could try:

mkdir parscalar-build
source szin++-parscalar-env.sh
../qdp/configure --fermion-type=wilson
gmake

to build a parscalar version. In this case szin++-parscalar-env.sh
will probably contain something like:

CXX=/usr/local/mpich/bin/mpiCC
QDP_CXXFLAGS="-I/usr/local/qdp-parscalar/include"
QDP_LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/qdp-parscalar/lib"
QDP_LIB="-lqdp"
QMP_CXXFLAGS="-I/usr/local/qmp-mpich/include"
QMP_LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/qmp-mpich/lib"
QMP_LIBS="-lqmp"
export CXX QDP_CXXFLAGS QDP_LDFLAGS QDP_LIB QMP_CXXFLAGS QMP_LDFLAGS QMP_LIBS

Note that QDP now provides values for most of these environment variables
automatically, by way of a script which can be sourced to set them (see
in the examples etc etc)

4) Building the documentation
-----------------------------

All in good time ...

5) More examples:
-----------------

Suppose you have configured QMP with mpicc, and have a QDP++ installation
(QDP version >= 0.26) in /home/bj/qdp-parscalar-install. You could configure
szin++ with:

./configure CXX=mpiCC --with-qdp=/home/bj/qdp-parscalar-install

where mpiCC would be the C++ wrapper supplied with your MPI distribution.

Suppose your MPI distribution didn't have a C++ wrapper, but you 
knew that g++ could compile and link your program, and you knew
that the MPI include files were in /usr/local/mpich-1.2.4/include
and that the library files were in /usr/local/mpich-1.2.4/lib, and that
mpicc linked libpmpich.a, libmpich.a and  libpmpich.a again, you could try:

./configure --enable-fermion-type=wilson \
 	    --with-qdp=/home/bj/Devel/qdp-parscalar-install \
	    --with-qmp-comms-cxxflags="-I/usr/local/mpich-1.2.4/include" \
	    --with-qmp-comms-ldflags="-L/usr/local/mpich-1.2.4/lib" \
	    --with-qmp-comms-libs="-lpmpich -lmpich -lpmpich"

Here the --with-qmp-comms-xxx options override the ones in the qdp_build_env.sh
(where they probably weren't set anyway as mpicc hid them), but the rest of the
environment variables QDP_CXXFLAGS, QDP_LDFLAGS, QDP_LIBS, QMP_CXXFLAGS, \
QMP_LDFLAGS and QMP_LIBS are still picked up from the qdp_build_env.sh
