06/14/2005 -- Balint Joo
	Version 1.22.3. Fixed various things in the build system.
        GMP is now enabled with --with-gmp=<DIR>. DIR is optional.
	If not given one can use env variables GMP_CXXFLAGS, GMP_LDFLAGS
	and GMP_LIBS. If these environment variables are empty, GMP_LIBS
	will be defined as -lgmp assuming that the GMP is in a standard
	location. Not specifying --with-gmp disables building the GMP
	remez code

	The BAGEL WILSON DSLASH is now enabled with --with-bagel-wilson-dslash=DIR. DIR is optional. If not given it falls back to environment variables
        BAGEL_WILSON_DSLASH_CXXFLAGS, BAGEL_WILSON_DSLASH_LDFLAGS, BAGEL_WILSON_DSLASH_LIBS. Not giving the --with-bagel-wilson-dslash option disables the
use of the bagel wilson dslash

        of the FermBC is done within the construction of the FermAct.
        Similarly, HMC will create FermActs as needed. The old "boundary"
        within propagator.cc input is now shoved into the FermionAction
        xml.

        initialization. New support for variable initialization.

09/28/2004 -- Balint

     -- ZolotarevStateInfo has been renamed to OverlapStateInfo
	( and the previous empty OverlapStateInfo base class has been removed)

     -- I have added the state_info field to Propagator_Input_t 
	  as a standard string. I had it in ChromaProp_t first but I 
	  believe it should not be part of the <Param> </Param>
	  tagset but rather live at the same level as Cfg_t in the
	  top level applications. Look in propagator.cc to see how 
	  I manage it. Essentially I do this (propagator.cc line 84):

    // Read any auxiliary state information
    // if it exists
    if( inputtop.count("StateInfo") == 1 ) {
      XMLReader xml_state_info(inputtop, "StateInfo");
      std::ostringstream os;
      xml_state_info.print(os);
      input.stateInfo = os.str();
    }
    else {
    // Write an empty <?xml ... ><StateInfo/> document if not 
    // found 
      XMLBufferWriter s_i_xml;
      push(s_i_xml, "StateInfo");
      pop(s_i_xml);
      input.stateInfo = s_i_xml.str();
    }

    I have added dummy createState() functions to the various
    fermacts that read from an XML containing StateInfo. Apart
    from the overlap, these createState()-s just ignore
    the XML, but this virtual func could be a good hook for you
    if you add StateInfo to some ZolotarevCoeff-ed DWF fermacts.
    In fact, if you just write these, they'll be picked up appropriately
    by propagator...

    A sample usage of state info is in 
	chroma/tests/propagator/propagator_zolo4d_v6.xml.in

    -- As agreed, I have removed backward compatibility with 
    SZIN - type vectors in createOverlapState() -- now just 
    uses my evecs.

    -- I have written factory functions for creating OverlapConnectState-s
    in overlap_state.h overlap_state.cc. I originally wrote these
    as templated funcs, but then I couldn't shove them into the .cc file
    - they'd needed to have stayed in the .h file where the prototypes
    are defined. So I did similar things to the Inverter functions. 
    I wrote out the "specialisations" in the .h file and wrapped a templated
    version in the .cc. Your fermact's createState()-s can just dive on these
    see ovlap_partfrac_4d_fermact_w.[h,cc]. The issue of 4D and 5D BC's is
    hacked around as discussed:

  	i) The aux ferm act gets trivial BC-s. This doesn't matter as 
	   we never use them. We always use the BC-s of the parent.
       ii) the createOverlapState() function is passed a linOp which
	   the caller FermAct constructs. AuxMass is therefore no longer
	   passed
       iii) the createOverlapState() function creates a SimpleConnectState
           internally to call the passed linOp with, after applying
	   the modifyU() function of the passed FermBC

    -- Zolotarev4DFermAct and Zolotarev5DFermActArray have been renamed:
     as  OverlapPartFrac4DFermAct
     and 
	 UnprecOverlapContFrac5DFermActArray

     and put in ovlap_partfrac4d_fermact_w.[h,cc] 
         and    unprec_ovlap_contfrac4d_fermact_array_w.[h,cc] 

    the zolotarev5d_linop_array_w.[h,cc] is still there but will
    also be renamed real soon now.  

    -- I have removed the double mappings for backward compatibility
    ZOLOTAREV_4D and ZOLOTAREV_5D are dead. Now you need to specify
    something like:

  <FermionAction>
    <FermAct>OVERLAP_PARTIAL_FRACTION_4D</FermAct>
    <IsChiral>true</IsChiral>
    <ApproximationType>ZOLOTAREV</ApproximationType>
    <Mass>0.04</Mass>
    <RatPolyDeg>17</RatPolyDeg>
    <InnerSolve>
      <MaxCG>1000</MaxCG>
      <RsdCG>1.0e-7</RsdCG>
      <ReorthFreq>20</ReorthFreq>
    </InnerSolve>
    <AuxFermAct>
      <FermAct>UNPRECONDITIONED_WILSON</FermAct>
      <Mass>-1.4</Mass>
    </AuxFermAct>
  </FermionAction>

   Other new FermActs:

 	"UNPRECONDITIONED_OVERLAP_CONTINUED_FRACTION_5D"
and soon "OVERLAP_CONTINUED_FRACTION_5D" (which will be preconditioned)

    
    ApproximationType can be "ZOLOTAREV" or "TANH" for now.
    Robert feel free to add your own here if you want. 

	io/enum_io/enum_coeffs_io.[h,cc]
	io/enum_io/enum_fermacttype_io.[h,cc]

    I have removed therefore the old XML input files from the repository
    and added in the new ones.

    -- Approximation type can now also be TANH with the following caveats:

	i) rescaling: I am still not clear on this. I may not need
	to do this at all or I may need to do it the same way 
	as done in the ZOLO case. I'll ask Tony.
	
	ii) projection: I saw in your paper that in the Borici 
	(TANH) case, the EigValFunc is not signum but in fact 
	the polar approximation: \epsilon_{Ls/2}


    -- Also note from the above XML, that as agreed, I pushed the IsChiral
    to be a user supplied parameter. So that if we have a bad approximation
    for Zolotarev we can set it to false. Likewise if we have a supremely
    high order tanh approximation with projection so that we are effectively
    chiral then you can set it to true.

    -- fermact_paramio.h fermact_paramio.cc zolotarev4d_fermact_paramio.h
       zolotarev4d_fermact_paramio.cc are GONE (removed from CVS)
       zolotarev5d_fermact_paramio.[h,cc] are still around but 
       will be gone real soon now.

	Version 1.5.6. Last changes (mostly overlap) before splitup of main codes.

04/23/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.5.5. More support for overlap.

04/22/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.5.4. BUG FIX in baryon_w.cc . The proton_{4,5,6} were converted
        incorrectly from szin. 
        Cleanups in gauge initialization. Overlap support now in propagator codes.

04/21/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.5.3. New version of propagator input. New wall-sink
        formfactor codes. New multi-prop. support.

04/05/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.5.2. Start of support for SZINQIO.

04/01/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.5.1. Added non-relativistic support to seqprop.

02/22/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.5.0. Major change in propagator model in main programs. ONLY
        support SciDAC format of propagators. Now, the "Param" group on input is the
        header of some propagator. There are XML and binary parts of propagators
        (SciDAC format). The XML part is used in subsequent calculations, thus removing
        potentially erroneous use of input params in calcs.
        All test files changed to match

02/22/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.4.4. Some new programs added. Fixed make_source/propagator/seqprop/spectrum
        chain of tests to be consistent and give reasonable output. Cross-checked against
        new (un-committed) XML driven input/output model.

01/27/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.4.3. Overhauled SSE Wilson dslash support. New index tables.

01/26/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.4.2. More eigenvalue stuff. Tagging pre-release of the
        new SSE Wilson dslash support.

01/07/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.4.1. Functioning Zolotarev code by Balint Joo.
	Also, added WILSON and STAGGERED build control.

01/01/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.4.0. Removed all proxies. Switched to only use Handles
	(proxies were just glorified handles). Changed fermact factory
	functions to require a Handle<const ConnectState>  instead of a
	pointer to a connect state.  Added Fermion and Gauge BC support.
	Now a new virtual getFermBC in FermAct.  Now, the semantics is
	the FermAct is responsible for applying the Fermionic BC. All
	the fermacts changed to pass a FermBC which is then applied
	to the U fields in createState. This is supplied as a default
	in createState. 
        First tentative code for pure gauge heatbath and dyn. ferm. HMC.

12/31/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.3.2. More tweaks in fermacts. Added first versions
        of heatbath and HMC (not working yet).
        This is a pre-release before major changes to come. The next
        version changes substantially the fermacts - now gauge and
        fermion BC are included in the proper way.

12/06/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.3.1. Added various gauge fixing routines.

12/02/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.3.0. Another overhaul of FermionAction support. Now
        create and pass around gauge connection state.

12/01/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.2.1. Minor tweaks. Pre-release for 1.3.0 .

11/23/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.2.0. Overhauled FermionAction and LinearOperator. Added
        new even-odd preconditioned support.

11/20/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.1.4. Switched LinearOperator and FermionAction interfaces to
        pass what was return type as instead argument to operator() & apply (linop)
        and dsdu (fermact).

11/20/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.1.3. Small tweaks.

11/16/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.1.2. Added extended-overlap action and linop.

11/14/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.1.1. Rearranged fermact files and made more base classes.
        Merged separate dsdu and qprop files into corresponding fermact files.

11/14/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.1.0. Added array versions of fermacts. Now have functioning
        unprecondition DWF operator.

10/09/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.0.1. Changed all cout/cerr/QDP_info to use QDPIO::cout/cerr.

10/07/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.0.0. First major release. Supports sse extensions. Several
        bits in production. More to come.
