July 4, 2012 - Robert Edwards
        Version 3.42.0
        Imported changes from devel branch (new propagator support).

Oct 29, 2010 - Robert Edwards
        Version 3.40.0
        Overhauled usage of MapObject classes to match new QDP++ interface. The
        MapObjectDisk now supports multiple closure/openings/insertions.

Oct 09, 2010 - Robert Edwards
        Version 3.39.0
        Pulled out the MapObject classes, made them more general, and put them in QDP.
        Cleaned out some old regression tests.

Jan 07, 2010 - Robert Edwards
        Version 3.38.0
        New FILEDB interface down in QDP++. Changed Chroma's SerialDBKey/Data to match 
        accordingly.

Jan 07, 2010 - Balint Joo
        Version 3.38.0
        Merged 3.37.2 devel branch onto master. Fixed regression checks.
        Ready to go into stable

Jan 01, 2010 - Robert Edwards
	Version 3.37.2
        Made a combined prop_colorvec and prop_matelem_colorvec that saves
        prop dbs and combines in the peram construction. Can avoid using
        lookups for solution vectors or storing all the solutions in memory/disk.

Dec 31, 2009 - Robert Edwards
	Version 3.37.1
        Moved old inline_prop_matelem_colorvec to a low-memory version.
        New inline_prop_matelem_colorvec reorganizes the loops to cut-down
        on lookups.

Dec 27, 2009 - Robert Edwards
	Version 3.37.0
        Balint wrote a nifty MapObjectDisk and MapObjectMemory that function like
        databases. A use is to hold lattice objects. New factory system for the
        beasties. Removed uses of SubsetVectors in favor of MapObject's. Cleaned
        out some old routines. Lots of other cleanups. Rearranged more the MapObject
        task system.

Sep 14, 2009 - Robert Edwards
	Version 3.36.1
        Switched back to old inline genprop code. Changed inline colorvec codes
        to check for DB existence. If it does not exist, insert the metadata,
        else do not reinsert. Lots of improvements in laph codes. 

Aug 25, 2009 - Robert Edwards
	Version 3.36.0
        The start of a hybrid stochastic-distillation method (called LAPH -
        horrible name) by Colin and John. Changed how genprops are contracted
        in an effort to speed it up. Balint did lots of XLC cleanups.

July 14, 2009 - Robert Edwards
	Version 3.35.0
        Balint did all this in 3.34.1, but the latter was never actually
        tagged it. John Bulava added new measurement routines related to
        distilled dilution.

7/8/2009 - Balint
	Version 3.34.1
        Added IBiCGStab for BiCGStab with 1 Global Reduction per iteration
	Added Reliable IBiCGStab (Clover only) to allow multi-precision use.
 	Added Regressions, tweaked output. 	

05/202009 - Balint Joo
	Added Multi-Prec BiCGStab Solver (LinOp & MdagM) (Clover Only)
	Added Internally Single Precision CG Solver (MdagM only,Clover Only)

04/21/2009 - Balint Joo
	Version 3.34.0
	Added regression support for multiprec clover in propagator and t_leapfrog
	Integrated cpp-wilson-dslash for multiprec dslash support. (Experimental)


03/04/2009 - Robert Edwards  
	Version 3.33.0
        Changed around eigcg support for MdagM and M. New block colorvec support 
        by Kostas. New sloppy precision sse-dslash support by Balint. Disco eigcg
        by Kostas and Christopher.

01/26/2009 - Robert Edwards  
	Version 3.32.0
        Delta tau version of min-norm-2 integrators. New stochastic
        insertion for 3-pt corr.  Added static prop colorvec. Added grid
        sources. IO for eigcg vecs. Disconnected routines. Added static_light_cont
        and heavy_light_cont.

11/11/2008 - Robert Edwards  
	Version 3.31.1
        Fixed the "E" tensor operator in util/ferm/etensor. Reimplemented
        deriv. seqsources to reuse basic routines. Checked against old deriv.
        seqsources.

11/11/2008 - Robert Edwards  
	Version 3.31.0
        New stochastic generalized prop (3-pt) by Kostas. Added twisted-mass to
        clover. Put DB's into projection use. Fixed up colorvec generalized prop.
        New ILU style time-prec for clover. New readers for eigvecs.

08/26/2008 - Robert Edwards  
	Version 3.30.4
        Changed format of colorvec dbs. Now use fixed record dbs.

08/26/2008 - Robert Edwards  
	Version 3.30.3
        A working version of the colorvec chain.

08/02/2008:  
	Version 3.30.2
  	Balint did some rework of the comms in the sse wilson dslash.
        Started adding some Berkeley DB flags, but these will all change.

07/21/2008:  
	Version 3.30.1
        Kostas added some static-light routines from Will Detmold.

05/30/2008:  
	Version 3.30.0
  	Major overhaul of monomial structure which are now of the form

	   pseudoferm term		   tag
	  A=M^dag*M chi*A_1^-1*chi         two_flavor
	  chi*M_2*A_1^-1*M_2^dag*chi	   two_flavor_ratio_conv_conv
	  chi*R(A_2)*A_1^-1*R(A_2)*chi	   two_flavor_ratio_conv_rat
	  chi*R(A_1)*chi		   one_flavor_rat
	  chi*M_2*R(A_1)*M_2^dag*chi	   one_flavor_ratio_rat_conv
	  chi*R(A_2)*R(A_1)*R(M_2)*chi	   one_flavor_ratio_rat_rat

	  This structure exists for both 4D and 5D variants. Not all are
	  implemented at the level of the derivatives, but can be. The 5D
	  monomials no longer have an explicit reference to the
	  Pauli-Villars (PV) linOpPV.  That linOp is now added as an
	  appropriate separate monomial or the M_2 term. This is handled
	  simply by giving a DWF-like fermact with a quark mass of 1, or it
	  might require a kind of PV fermact in the case of some of the
	  more esoteric 5D actions.

05/22/2008:  
	Version 3.29.2
	Precision related tweaks in some HMC monomials. Some new variants of qqqNucNuc
        measurements and hadron_contract measurements.

05/06/2008:  
	Version 3.29.0
	 -- Support for MDWF Moebius DWF Library cleaned up and ready to go.

05/05/2008
	Maintenance: 
	-- Added support for interfacing to MDWF Moebius DWF library from MIT.
	   Currently only the Shamir variant of DWF is used and only in the
           propagator code.
	   Currently we are having difficulties with mixed precision so 
           I am enabling the double precision only.

05/02/2008
	Version 3.28.5 - Maintenance release:
	some changes here and there, but most importantly,
	first version of the code to attempt to read write usqcd propagators

	THIS VERSION NOW NEEDS qdp++ CVS Version qdp1-26-0 to build

	Known problems:
		FIXME: scalar-7n: asqtad candidate  RUN_FAILS
	                  sink_smearing_s.candidate RUN_FAILS
	                  spectrum_s.candidate.xml RUN_FAILS

01/21/2008 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.28.1 - Cleaned out old intel_sse_dslash code. Removed all
        stand-alone stout_smear routines. Changed task version to go through
        stout_utils package. Some new versions of 2+2 gaugeacts. Some more
        control over eigbounds.

01/21/2008 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.28.0 - Overhauled plaq_gaugeact and lwldslash classes to now
        use a general form of anistropy coeffients - on all plaqs or links. Now
        have support for 2+2 anisotropy. New time-prec. ILU Clover hmc. New NPR
        code. New HISQ code. Some new measurements for hadron_contract for deltas.

11/29/2007 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.27.1 - Bug fix in stout_smear. This appeared in the link_smearing
        but not in the fermion action smearing (the fermstate codes).

11/12/2007 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.27.0 - First 3d SSE dslash. New SLIC-like and SLRC fermion actions.
        Some new tasks. Working Eigenvalue accelerated CG code. Changed prop readers
        to allow an optional Config_info.

10/26/2007 -- Balint Joo
	Version 3.26.0 - New Dslash written in intrinsics with unit test suite and 
        complete QMT harness (as opposed to just 32bit parscalar). 
        --enable-sse-wilson-dslash now enables new dslash. However this may be 
        slow on 32 bit systems and pentia (rather than opterons). So the old GCC 
        Inline assembly dslash can be enabled instead with the --enable-sse-wilson-dslash-old 
        configure switch. Both new and old dslashes cannot be in the same build. 
        Its one or t'other. Code passed regressions on 7n and compiled and passed 
        all regressions but the mres one in parscalar-single with the Intel compiler 
        and the new dslash.

10/24/2007 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.25.0 - New qdp-lapack package included in other_libs. New
        system-solver routine "eigcg" that uses Kostas' eigenvector acceleration
        technique. Renamed the eoprec logdet monomial to agree with other naming
        schemes.

09/12/2007 -- Balint Joo
        Version 3.24.3 - Lots of tydiups and fixes especially to SF related code.
        5D solvers work with GCC-4. Additions for 7n related regression testing.
        CG-DWF problems hopefully fixed in the chroma-config script file.

08/23/2007 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.24.2 - Cleaned up some SF Dirichlet code. Mainly, this version
        marks a QDP++ version that has QIO properly working on mesh machines.

08/14/2007 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.24.1 - Some rearrangement in "hadron_contract" routines. Now
        those regressions work in parallel. This code requires at least 
        QDP++ version 1.24.3 or greater.

07/17/2007 -- Balint Joo
	Version 3.24.0 - Loads of I/O related stuff from Robert. Balint had 
        Clover related improvements including support for bagel_clover
        on BG/Ls, speed improvements to clover force etc through
        'cleanup'. Negative Logdets hopefully gone (but not forgotten) as we
        moved to L^\dag D L inversion of clover term rather than Cholesky. The
        former can cope with an indefinite matrix (as long as it is
        invertible) the latter can't.

04/19/2007 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.23.0 - Moved around some monomial files in anticipation of big reorg
        of Remez and InvertParam groups. New output from hadspec.

05/03/2007 -- Balint Joo
	Version 3.22.7 - BG/L fixes for BAGEL dslash op (refcounting etc)
	      New CG-DWF option --enable-cg-dwf-lowmem for a lower memory CG-DWF
	      New CG option --enable-cg-solver-restart for a single CG restart
	      RsdCG and MaxCG can be independently speficied by <RsdCGRestart>
	      and <MaxCGRestart> in the inv Param file. This works by default
	      for CG-DWF solves and the tags are respected in other CG solvers if
	      --enable-cg-solver-restart is enabled. Otherwise these XML tags
	      are ignored.  

27/02/2007 -- Balint Joo
	Version 3.22.6 - Cleanded out subsets. Regressions pass but needs recent 
	QDP++ (1.22.0 at least). Merged in Robert's recent changes. Added Schur Preconditioned Space,
	Central Time preconditioned Wilson Operator.

22/02/2007 -- Balint Joo
	Version 3.22.5 - Stamp before making subset related changes

18/02/2007 -- Balint Joo
 	Added ILU Preconditioned space and  Central Preconditioned Time Wilson And Clover 
	Actions. Amazingly these actually work.

15/02/2007 -- Balint Joo
	First cut Unprec Space Central Prec Time Wilson Fermions. Complete with regression tests 

8/02/2007 -- Balint Joo
	Bug fix for linking: Removed enum_wvfkind files to attic. Unincluded
	them from  enum_io.h

12/10/2006 -- Balint Joo
	Version 3.22.1. Bug fix in how MD chronological predictor is reset.

12/10/2006 -- Balint Joo
	Version 3.22.0. Overhaul of the MD integrator codes. Now recursive. Removed
        old code.

12/10/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.21.1. Mostly housecleaning. Removed many obsolete source construction 
        and quark smearing codes and enums. Added a Klein-Gordon operator. 

12/04/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.21.0. Overhauled sequential source construction. Now have loads
        of working derivative sources. New regression tests that cross check the
        sequential propagator via the tie-back test and compares to a 2-pt at
        the sink. Standardized propagator headers - now have fixed structs and
        not the floating xml stuff.

11/25/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.20.0. New component integrator codes for HMC. New staggered
        chroma task chain of  MAKE_SOURCE, PROPAGATOR and SINK_SMEARING .
        Fixes in NPR task codes.

11/07/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.19.1. NPR code compiles and linked, but not fully tested.
        Small fix in AVP DWF-cg wrapper to correct cg-counts.

10/31/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.19.0. Split apart the fermact.h file into lots of
        separate bits to make it easier to manage. Split up the linearop.h
        file more as well. Split up and rearranged the tprec_linop.h files for
        the anticipated new time-preconditioning. Added some new functionality
        here.  For neatness sake, moved and renamed all the "prec_*" files
        (which are specific to 4d even-odd preconditioning) to "eoprec_*"
        filenames. Start of some new inline measurements not yet turned on.

10/31/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.18.0. New inline measurements Qll by K. Orginos.

10/14/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.17.0. Changes in BuildingBlocks (D. Renner, K. Orginos)
        to support time reversal and translation of source location. Removed
        inline_spectrum and inline_spectrumOct - superceded by inline_hadspec.
        Reset inline_propagator version to 9. Had to regenerate lots of
        regression tests. Removed old style restart support - now done down
        inside the system solvers.
        
10/11/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.16.1. Small fix in hadron_seqsource to make gcc4 happy.

10/10/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.16.0. Change in seqsource construction. Now pass in full 
        propagator headers as well as props. For baryons, now compensate
        for time-ordering of source and sink baryons as well as the
        spurious phase from a quark source not at the spatial origin.

10/10/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.15.1. Small changes in plaq+adj gauge action. Other small
        regression test cleanups.

09/21/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.15.0. Added new ferm and gauge create state inlines.
        Changed some inlines to now use the ferm or gauge state, or at
        least the param group.

09/21/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.14.7. Added a registration in inline_wilslp

09/21/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.14.6. Major housecleaning. Changed all the uses of the
	registration method to now be **runtime**. The "registerAll()"
	function is exposed that will register the thingy. There is a
	private "registered" flag that is initially false and then set
	to true upon registration done at runtime.

09/18/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.14.5. House cleaning. Split off all gauge states
	and ferm states to their own gaugestates and fermstates
	directories. Changed all the paths.

09/14/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.14.0. New chroma/other_libs/cg-dwf package now
	included. The DWF QpropT routine reworked to use the new package
	(double prec. SSE). Changed hmc to split output into XMLLOG
	and XMLDAT.

09/09/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.12.0. First apparently working version of stout force
	code for HMC.  Rearrangements in stouting for gauge and fermion
	actions.

08/28/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.11.2. Small but important edge case in stout_fermstate
	fixed.	Bug fix in SftMom handling in test of zero_offset. Small
	fix in inline_hadspec allowing optional displacement type
	field. Retooled all important update routines, stouts, fermacts,
	etc. to use START_CODE/END_CODE.

08/24/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.11.1. Fixed regression metric in mesons from v3.11.0 .
	Rearranged mesplq and added measurements of all plaquette planes.
	Regenerated all regression output since they depend on the
	plaquette output. Fully converted the block-ing code along with
	fuzglue, polycor and gluecor.

08/19/2006 -- George T. Fleming
	Version 3.11.0.  Changed the interface of the slow Fourier
	transform (SftMom) class to allow for any lattice point to be
	chosen as the spatial origin.  Previously, this meant that the
	origin was always implicitly (0,0,0,0), which lead to various
	phase problems.  One example is 2pt correlation functions between
	a point source not at the origin and a sink at non-zero momentum:
	the overall phase depends upon the location of the source.
	Using the new interface, the phase can be made independent of
	the location of the source by choosing the origin of the Fourier
	transform to be the location of the source.  Several things remain
	to be fixed:  (1) sequential sources at non-zero sink momentum,
	(2) building blocks with link paths which cross boundaries, (3)
	baryonic sequential sources where t_source > t_sink, i.e. the
	boundary is between the source and sink.

08/17/2006 -- Balint Joo
	Version 3.10.4. Fixed stout fermstate to support smear_dir.
	New form of purgaug input/output.

08/15/2006 -- Balint Joo
	Version 3.10.3. Stout Fermstate rides. Reinterpret nontrivialP()
	flag to mean underlying gauge boundaries are trivial in FermBC-s
	only (ie still old meaning in GaugeBC-s for now). Stout Fermstate
	tested for SF, periodic, antiperiodic, and Dirichlet fermion
	BCs. Twisted Ferm BC_s are not expected to work.

07/27/2006 -- Balint Joo
	Version 3.10.2. Patches to SSE DWF CG to support double-prec sums.
	Added more optimized plaq+two_plaq gauge monomial. Added profiling
	to inline_eigbnds in 5D case.

07/21/2006 -- Balint Joo
	Version 3.10.1. Added two_plaq monomials.

07/11/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.9.0. Changed interface to the inline WILSLP and MESONSPEC.
        Turned on  HADRON_SPECTRUM (hadspec). This is a replacement for SPECTRUM.

07/11/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.8.2. More small fixes in wilslp (Wilson loops).

07/06/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.8.1. Fixes in wilslp (Wilson loops).

07/04/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.8.0. Changed FermionAction API to produce system
        solver classes. No longer have a fixed InvertParam
	set. Removed old inverter enum and support. Have default creation
	for inverters to solve M*psi=chi, MdagM*psi=chi, and multi-shift
	support. Some older files still have explicit calls to CG solver.
        Converted usage of  source/source_type, fermact, sink/sink_type
        to using GroupXML_t. Converted all monomials to use GroupXML_t as
        well.

07/03/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.7.4. 5D Hasenbusch monomial support.

06/18/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.7.3. Bug fix in xml output in task MESONSPEC. Some code cleanups to make
        various compilers happy.

06/11/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.7.2. Fixed param path in inline_link_smear.

06/11/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.7.1. Bug fixes. Removed all use of linkSmear - it is problematic
        with the current qdp++.

06/11/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.7.0. Change in quarkProp and SystemSolver interface. 
	QuarkProp now takes a number of tries (restarts) at calling the qprop routine. 
	The SystemSolver routines now return a structure of iteration counts and
	residual. Changed all regression tests to use this new propagator option
	(version 10).

06/08/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.6.2. Improved memory usage with inline_mesonspec. Some 
        fixes/improvements in polynomial linops. New parallel regression runners.

05/26/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.6.1. Improved inline_mesonspec. Small bug fix down in
        64bit SSE wilson dslash (intel_sse_wilson_dslash).

05/24/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.6.0. New format for inline_mesonspec. Added spin insertions. 
        Overhauled inline_stoch_baryon. Removed quark_smear_first/last from
        shell source/sink construction/smearing. Now print true residuals
        in some inversion routines.

05/19/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.5.1. Added no-quark-smearing.

05/17/2006 -- Balint Joo
	Version 3.4.2. Added Support for configurable testcase runners.
	Added mpirun_rsh runner. This runner is currently hardwired to 
	run the tests on qcd6n277 and qcd6n278

05/11/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.4.1. First possibly working version of stoch_baryon task.

05/10/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.4.0. Moved stoch_meson to an inline measurement. Removed stoch_meson.cc
        mainprog. Made a new stoch_baryon inline measurement - not functional yet.
        Fixed 5D fermacts to actually call their desired quarkProp routines. They
        were missing the "const" qualifier at the end of the decl (thus new funcs
        not seen by virtual funcs).

05/09/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.3.0. Upgraded SHELL_SOURCE,SHELL_SMEARING and SHELL_SINK
        inline tasks to now take an order of the smearing versus displacements.

04/26/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.2.1. Removed SNARF task - was superceded. Added NERSC reader
        task. Cleanups and generlization of sfpcac support.

04/18/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.2.0. Switched purgaug to using the gauge action construction.
        Still somewhat limited, though. Putting legit aniso support in more of the
        gauge actions - still more is needed.

04/14/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.1.1. Small changes. configure.ac now writes an empty run command for
        make xcheck.

04/11/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.1.0. Big change on chroma,hmc,purgaug input - one must now always
        specify the input gauge field on tasks that need it. The default reader
        has been removed. Added more Schroedinger functional measurements.

04/04/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.0.1. Minor compilation fixes.

04/03/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 3.0.0. Major overhaul of fermion and gauge action interface. Basically,
        all fermacts and gaugeacts now carry out  <T,P,Q>  template parameters. These are
        the fermion type, the "P" - conjugate momenta, and "Q" - generalized coordinates
        in the sense of Hamilton's equations. The fermbc's have been rationalized to never
        be over multi1d<T>. The "createState" within the FermionAction is now fixed meaning
        the "u" fields are now from the coordinate type. There are now "ConnectState" that
        derive into FermState<T,P,Q> and GaugeState<P,Q>.

03/21/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 2.15.3. Bug fix, or rather new addition to funcmap. Changed all
        IO funcmaps to disambiguate them and not pile onto the same funcmap!!!

03/21/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 2.15.2. Bug fixes in new derivative displacements. Changed around
        output regression tests. Some cleanups in IO.

03/21/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 2.15.1. Removed use of overlap_state from various 5d fermacts
        since it is not used. Added more regression tests. Cleaned out some
        old input files.

03/20/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 2.15.0. Major change of inline suite. There is no longer a gauge field
        passed into the measurements. Instead, tasks must read a gauge field. By default,
        they all will try to read a "default_gauge_field" buffer placed there by the
        main program. With this change, any task can smear a gauge field and hand
        that to the next task for use instead of having to write the config, exiting,
        and restarting.

03/16/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 2.14.0. Major overhaul in GaugeBC's and FermBC's . New initial
        support for Schroedinger functional BC's. The GaugeBC's seem to work
        under HMC (at least energy is conserved). Carried over BC's known under
        SZIN. However, the FermBC's don't conserve energy yet. This is understood -
        the LinOP.deriv() functions do not know the BC's hence can't enforce
        them - only important to HMC. This needs more work.

03/06/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 2.13.4. Backed out changes to clover with external field. It's
        breaking something but passes regression test.

03/06/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 2.13.3. Changes to mesonspec code.

03/02/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 2.13.2. Added new partial wall source. More regression tests. Added
        flop counts on clover. Start of new simplistic (minimal) meson and future
        baryon spectroscopy.

02/23/2006 -- Balint Joo & Thomas Streuer
        Version 2.12.0. MultiMass overlap and eigenvector projection. 
        Inline Ritz measurement. Some XML magic needed in writing the 
        multiple props. For this reason	we now need qdp1-20-1.

02/21/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 2.11.0. Yet another overhaul. This time, the idea of "displacement"
        in make_source and sink_smear has been generalized to another factory generated
        object. Now have lots of derivative things that are "displacements" of a source
        or sink. More regression tests. New staggered spectrum regression tests and code.

02/16/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 2.10.1. Removed chroma_config.h from chromabase.h and instead only
        include it in routines that require it. Thus, recompilations are drastically
        lowered upon changing versions. Added timing to SSE DWF CG.

02/16/2006 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 2.10.0. Changed naming scheme for Monomials. The fermact is no longer
        in the run-time monomial name.

        Wilson-esque dslashes. New clover support. Most importantly, start of new
        rigourous regression test system.

12/18/2005 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 2.6.1. Updated many regression tests to now use a new WEAK_FIELD
        instead of using the SZIN chroma/tests/test_purgaug.cfg1   config.

12/14/2005 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 2.6.0. Changed FermionAction (fermact.h) interface to use a
        quarkSpinType instead of a nonRelProp. Now, there can be FULL,UPPER,LOWER
        quark prop calculations.

12/08/2005 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 2.5.5. Small cleanups to make gcc4.0 happy.

11/30/2005 -- Robert Edwards

        fine. Added LINK_SMEAR inline to replace all the separate inlines.

11/20/2005 -- Robert Edwards

        for quark source construction, quark source smearing, quark sink smearing,
        quark smearing generically, and link smearing. MAKE_SOURCE and SINK_SMEAR
        now use these  source_construction, and sink_smearing, resp.

        explicit FermBC args from FermAct factories and now the creation
        of the FermBC is done within the construction of the FermAct.
        Similarly, HMC will create FermActs as needed. The old "boundary"
        within propagator.cc input is now shoved into the FermionAction
        xml.

12/23/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.11.3. More HMC changes.

12/22/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.11.2. New HMC support. First versions of Monomials.

        structure. Removed dsdu stuff - now in linops. Introduced
        levels of fermacts (base or not) that have derivs. All low
        level fermacts/linops have an additional template param for
        type of conjugate momenta in derivative. Made all fermacts and
        linops within chroma namespace.

12/09/2004 -- Robert Edwards

09/28/2004 -- Balint

     -- ZolotarevStateInfo has been renamed to OverlapStateInfo
	( and the previous empty OverlapStateInfo base class has been removed)

     -- I have added the state_info field to Propagator_Input_t 
	  as a standard string. I had it in ChromaProp_t first but I 
	  believe it should not be part of the <Param> </Param>
	  tagset but rather live at the same level as Cfg_t in the
	  top level applications. Look in propagator.cc to see how 
	  I manage it. Essentially I do this (propagator.cc line 84):

    // Read any auxiliary state information
    // if it exists
    if( inputtop.count("StateInfo") == 1 ) {
      XMLReader xml_state_info(inputtop, "StateInfo");
      std::ostringstream os;
      xml_state_info.print(os);
      input.stateInfo = os.str();
    }
    else {
    // Write an empty <?xml ... ><StateInfo/> document if not 
    // found 
      XMLBufferWriter s_i_xml;
      push(s_i_xml, "StateInfo");
      pop(s_i_xml);
      input.stateInfo = s_i_xml.str();
    }

    I have added dummy createState() functions to the various
    fermacts that read from an XML containing StateInfo. Apart
    from the overlap, these createState()-s just ignore
    the XML, but this virtual func could be a good hook for you
    if you add StateInfo to some ZolotarevCoeff-ed DWF fermacts.
    In fact, if you just write these, they'll be picked up appropriately
    by propagator...

    A sample usage of state info is in 
	chroma/tests/propagator/propagator_zolo4d_v6.xml.in

    -- As agreed, I have removed backward compatibility with 
    SZIN - type vectors in createOverlapState() -- now just 
    uses my evecs.

    -- I have written factory functions for creating OverlapConnectState-s
    in overlap_state.h overlap_state.cc. I originally wrote these
    as templated funcs, but then I couldn't shove them into the .cc file
    - they'd needed to have stayed in the .h file where the prototypes
    are defined. So I did similar things to the Inverter functions. 
    I wrote out the "specialisations" in the .h file and wrapped a templated
    version in the .cc. Your fermact's createState()-s can just dive on these
    see ovlap_partfrac_4d_fermact_w.[h,cc]. The issue of 4D and 5D BC's is
    hacked around as discussed:

  	i) The aux ferm act gets trivial BC-s. This doesn't matter as 
	   we never use them. We always use the BC-s of the parent.
       ii) the createOverlapState() function is passed a linOp which
	   the caller FermAct constructs. AuxMass is therefore no longer
	   passed
       iii) the createOverlapState() function creates a SimpleConnectState
           internally to call the passed linOp with, after applying
	   the modifyU() function of the passed FermBC

    -- Zolotarev4DFermAct and Zolotarev5DFermActArray have been renamed:
     as  OverlapPartFrac4DFermAct
     and 
	 UnprecOverlapContFrac5DFermActArray

     and put in ovlap_partfrac4d_fermact_w.[h,cc] 
         and    unprec_ovlap_contfrac4d_fermact_array_w.[h,cc] 

    the zolotarev5d_linop_array_w.[h,cc] is still there but will
    also be renamed real soon now.  

    -- I have removed the double mappings for backward compatibility
    ZOLOTAREV_4D and ZOLOTAREV_5D are dead. Now you need to specify
    something like:

  <FermionAction>
    <FermAct>OVERLAP_PARTIAL_FRACTION_4D</FermAct>
    <IsChiral>true</IsChiral>
    <ApproximationType>ZOLOTAREV</ApproximationType>
    <Mass>0.04</Mass>
    <RatPolyDeg>17</RatPolyDeg>
    <InnerSolve>
      <MaxCG>1000</MaxCG>
      <RsdCG>1.0e-7</RsdCG>
      <ReorthFreq>20</ReorthFreq>
    </InnerSolve>
    <AuxFermAct>
      <FermAct>UNPRECONDITIONED_WILSON</FermAct>
      <Mass>-1.4</Mass>
    </AuxFermAct>
  </FermionAction>

   Other new FermActs:

 	"UNPRECONDITIONED_OVERLAP_CONTINUED_FRACTION_5D"
and soon "OVERLAP_CONTINUED_FRACTION_5D" (which will be preconditioned)

    
    ApproximationType can be "ZOLOTAREV" or "TANH" for now.
    Robert feel free to add your own here if you want. 

	io/enum_io/enum_coeffs_io.[h,cc]
	io/enum_io/enum_fermacttype_io.[h,cc]

    I have removed therefore the old XML input files from the repository
    and added in the new ones.

    -- Approximation type can now also be TANH with the following caveats:

	i) rescaling: I am still not clear on this. I may not need
	to do this at all or I may need to do it the same way 
	as done in the ZOLO case. I'll ask Tony.
	
	ii) projection: I saw in your paper that in the Borici 
	(TANH) case, the EigValFunc is not signum but in fact 
	the polar approximation: \epsilon_{Ls/2}


    -- Also note from the above XML, that as agreed, I pushed the IsChiral
    to be a user supplied parameter. So that if we have a bad approximation
    for Zolotarev we can set it to false. Likewise if we have a supremely
    high order tanh approximation with projection so that we are effectively
    chiral then you can set it to true.

    -- fermact_paramio.h fermact_paramio.cc zolotarev4d_fermact_paramio.h
       zolotarev4d_fermact_paramio.cc are GONE (removed from CVS)
       zolotarev5d_fermact_paramio.[h,cc] are still around but 
       will be gone real soon now.

02/22/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.5.0. Major change in propagator model in main programs. ONLY
        support SciDAC format of propagators. Now, the "Param" group on input is the
        header of some propagator. There are XML and binary parts of propagators
        (SciDAC format). The XML part is used in subsequent calculations, thus removing
        potentially erroneous use of input params in calcs.
        All test files changed to match

02/22/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.4.4. Some new programs added. Fixed make_source/propagator/seqprop/spectrum

	Also, added WILSON and STAGGERED build control.

01/01/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.4.0. Removed all proxies. Switched to only use Handles
	(proxies were just glorified handles). Changed fermact factory
	functions to require a Handle<const ConnectState>  instead of a
	pointer to a connect state.  Added Fermion and Gauge BC support.
	Now a new virtual getFermBC in FermAct.  Now, the semantics is
	the FermAct is responsible for applying the Fermionic BC. All
	the fermacts changed to pass a FermBC which is then applied
	to the U fields in createState. This is supplied as a default
	in createState. 
        First tentative code for pure gauge heatbath and dyn. ferm. HMC.

12/31/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.3.2. More tweaks in fermacts. Added first versions
        of heatbath and HMC (not working yet).
        This is a pre-release before major changes to come. The next
        version changes substantially the fermacts - now gauge and
        fermion BC are included in the proper way.

12/06/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.3.1. Added various gauge fixing routines.

12/02/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.1.4. Switched LinearOperator and FermionAction interfaces to
        pass what was return type as instead argument to operator() & apply (linop)
        and dsdu (fermact).

11/20/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.1.3. Small tweaks.

11/16/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.1.2. Added extended-overlap action and linop.

11/14/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.1.1. Rearranged fermact files and made more base classes.
        Merged separate dsdu and qprop files into corresponding fermact files.

11/14/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.1.0. Added array versions of fermacts. Now have functioning
        unprecondition DWF operator.

10/09/2003 -- Robert Edwards
