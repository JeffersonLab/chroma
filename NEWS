04/05/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.5.2. Start of support for SZINQIO.

04/01/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.5.1. Added non-relativistic support to seqprop.

02/22/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.5.0. Major change in propagator model in main programs. ONLY
        support SciDAC format of propagators. Now, the "Param" group on input is the
        header of some propagator. There are XML and binary parts of propagators
        (SciDAC format). The XML part is used in subsequent calculations, thus removing
        potentially erroneous use of input params in calcs.
        All test files changed to match

02/22/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.4.4. Some new programs added. Fixed make_source/propagator/seqprop/spectrum
        chain of tests to be consistent and give reasonable output. Cross-checked against
        new (un-committed) XML driven input/output model.

01/27/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.4.3. Overhauled SSE Wilson dslash support. New index tables.

01/26/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.4.2. More eigenvalue stuff. Tagging pre-release of the
        new SSE Wilson dslash support.

01/07/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.4.1. Functioning Zolotarev code by Balint Joo.
	Also, added WILSON and STAGGERED build control.

01/01/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.4.0. Removed all proxies. Switched to only use Handles
	(proxies were just glorified handles). Changed fermact factory
	functions to require a Handle<const ConnectState>  instead of a
	pointer to a connect state.  Added Fermion and Gauge BC support.
	Now a new virtual getFermBC in FermAct.  Now, the semantics is
	the FermAct is responsible for applying the Fermionic BC. All
	the fermacts changed to pass a FermBC which is then applied
	to the U fields in createState. This is supplied as a default
	in createState. 
        First tentative code for pure gauge heatbath and dyn. ferm. HMC.

12/31/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.3.2. More tweaks in fermacts. Added first versions
        of heatbath and HMC (not working yet).
        This is a pre-release before major changes to come. The next
        version changes substantially the fermacts - now gauge and
        fermion BC are included in the proper way.

12/06/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.3.1. Added various gauge fixing routines.

12/02/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.3.0. Another overhaul of FermionAction support. Now
        create and pass around gauge connection state.

12/01/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.2.1. Minor tweaks. Pre-release for 1.3.0 .

11/23/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.2.0. Overhauled FermionAction and LinearOperator. Added
        new even-odd preconditioned support.

11/20/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.1.4. Switched LinearOperator and FermionAction interfaces to
        pass what was return type as instead argument to operator() & apply (linop)
        and dsdu (fermact).

11/20/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.1.3. Small tweaks.

11/16/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.1.2. Added extended-overlap action and linop.

11/14/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.1.1. Rearranged fermact files and made more base classes.
        Merged separate dsdu and qprop files into corresponding fermact files.

11/14/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.1.0. Added array versions of fermacts. Now have functioning
        unprecondition DWF operator.

10/09/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.0.1. Changed all cout/cerr/QDP_info to use QDPIO::cout/cerr.

10/07/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.0.0. First major release. Supports sse extensions. Several
        bits in production. More to come.
