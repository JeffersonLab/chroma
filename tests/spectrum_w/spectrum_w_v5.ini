; SPECTRUM_W input file.
;
; This program is the input file for a spectrum_w test run on Wilson-type
; propagators
;
; NOTE: steps needed to run
;   1) first run the SZIN propagator test in szin/tests/propagator
;   2) link the propagator files 'propagator_{0,1,2}' into the directory
;      where the test will run
;   3) copy this file to a file named 'DATA' in the directory where the test
;      will run
;   4) run the 'spectrum_w' program in that directory and capture
;      the standard output into a file called 'RESULT'
;   5) Compare the generated file 'NMLDAT' to the appropriate .nml file
;      in chroma/tests/spectrum_w
;   6) Compare the standard output in 'RESULT' to the appropriate .res file
;      in chroma/tests/spectrum_w
;
; ANOTHER NOTE: This input file also works with the SZIN spectro4 program
;   and where they compute the same observables, the numbers should agree
;   (currently up to a sign)
