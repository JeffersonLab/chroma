; BAR3PTFN input file.
;
; This program is the input file for a baryon 3pt func. calculation
; test run on Wilson-type propagators
;
; NOTE: steps are needed
;   1) first run the SZIN propagator test in szin/tests/propagator
;   2) link in the propagator_0 file into the "szin/tests/seqprop" directory
;      and run the seqprop test. It will generate up to 6 propagators.
;   3) Link in the same propagator_0 file and the seqprop_0_{0,1,2,3,10} files
;      into the directory where the test will run.
;   4) copy this file to a file named 'DATA' in the directory where the test
;      will run
;   4) run the 'bar3ptfn' program in that directory and capture
;      the standard output into a file called 'RESULT'
;   5) Compare the generated file 'NMLDAT' to the appropriate .nml file
;      in chroma/tests/bar3ptfn
;   6) Compare the standard output in 'RESULT' to the appropriate .res file
;      in chroma/tests/bar3ptfn
;
; ANOTHER NOTE: The bar3ptfn program should also work with the input files
;   in szin/tests/bar3ptfn and where they compute the same observables,
;   the numbers should agree
