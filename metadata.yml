description: "The Chroma package supports data-parallel programming constructs for\
  \ lattice field theory and in particular lattice QCD. It uses the SciDAC QDP++ data-parallel\
  \ programming (in C++) that presents a single high-level code image to the user,\
  \ but can generate highly optimized code for many architectural systems including\
  \ single node workstations, multi and many-core nodes, clusters of nodes via QMP,\
  \ and classic vector computers."
