   *
   *  NOTE: this class is specifically using LatticeColorMatrix, but
   *  probably should generalized to a template. The point is that coordinates
   *  and momenta within HMC are general. The FermAct classes have a param
   *  type  (T,P) = (type of fermion, type of conjugate momenta) the latter
   *  part used in the deriv stuff. Here, the "zero" could be on any conjugate
   *  momenta. The modify, however, is usually on the coordinates which
   *  is often the LatticeColorMatrx. The FermBC has a template param
   *  for the fermion type that is used in the "modifyF", but is fixed 
   *  for a LatticeColorMatrix in the "modifyU".
