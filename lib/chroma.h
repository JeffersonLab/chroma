/*! \mainpage  CHROMA
 *
 * \section Description
 *
 * The Chroma package supports data-parallel programming constructs for
 * lattice field theory and in particular lattice QCD. It uses the
 * SciDAC QDP++ data-parallel programming (in C++) that presents a
 * single high-level code image to the user, but can generate highly
 * optimized code for many architectural systems including single node
 * workstations, multi-threaded SMP workstations (soon to come),
 * clusters of workstations via QMP, and classic std::vector computers.
