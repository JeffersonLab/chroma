   * Compute correlation functions between axial current or pseudescalar
   * density and boundary fields using Schroedinger BC.
   *
   * Also computed, on demand, are correlation functions between both
   * boundaries with zero, one (std::vector current) and two (axial current or
   * pseudoscalar density) insertions in the bulk. These currents are
   * controlled by the ZVfactP and ZAfactP boolean flags.
   *
   * Compute quark propagators by using the qprop SystemSolver.
   * The initial guess for the inverter is zero.
   *
   * The results are written to the xml file.
   *
   * For further details see the comments in the dependent subroutines.
