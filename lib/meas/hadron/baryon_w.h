 * For the Proton we take

 * |P_1, s_z=1/2> = (d C gamma_5 u) "u_up"

 * for the Lambda

 * |L_1, s_z=1/2> = 2*(u C gamma_5 d) "s_up" + (s C gamma_5 d) "u_up"
 *                  + (u C gamma_5 s) "d_up"

 * and for the Delta^+

 * |D_1, s_z=3/2> = 2*(d C gamma_- u) "u_up" + (u C gamma_- u) "d_up".

 * We have put "q_up" in quotes, since this is meant in the Dirac basis,
 * not in the 'DeGrand-Rossi' chiral basis used in the program!

 * For all baryons we compute a 'B_2' that differs from the 'B_1' above
 * by insertion of a gamma_4 between C and the gamma_{5,-}.
 * And finally, we also compute the non-relativistic baryons, 'B_3',
 * which up to a factor 1/2 are just the difference B_1 - B_2, as can
 * be seen by projecting to the "upper" components in the Dirac basis,
 * achieved by (1 + gamma_4)/2 q, for quark q.

 * The Proton_k is baryon 3*(k-1), the Lambda_k is baryon 3*(k-1)+1
 * and the Delta^+_k is baryon 3*(k-1)+2.
