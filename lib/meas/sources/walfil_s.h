 * where everything has even coordinates.

 * \param a            Source fermion (write)
 * \param slice        time slice
 * \param mu           direction of slice
 * \param color_index  Color index
 * \param src_index    Index which defines which corner of a cube on
 *                     the source time slice you want your source to
 *                     be on. The std::mapping from src_index to site is
 *                     lexicographic, i.e: 0 is (0,0,0), 1 is (1,0,0),
 *                     2 is (0,1,0), 3 is (1,1,0), 4 is (0,0,1),
 *                     5 is (1,0,1), 6 is (0,1,1) and 7 is (1,1,1).
